Virginiah Periah Kengara

## BACKGROUND
My name is Virginiah Periah Kengara. I am a passionate and enthusiastic scientist particularly in Bioinformatics. I hold a B.Sc. in Microbiology and Biotechnology from The University of Nairobi and a certificate in Software Development from moringa School . My area of interest are genetic engineering in molecular biology and bioinformatics has become an essential tool in genomics.

I am currently interning at the MMBU center at ICIPE Kenya and I am so excited for this opportunity which will equip me with skills in genomics,research  and computational methods. Moreover, having mentors and working on projects will be critical for my growth in the Bioinformatics career.

## MY VISION    
*  To be a leading researcher who leverages technology to solve problems in health sectors across Africa and bring advancements in the quality of medical research.
* To learn gene sequencing that is important in precision medicine.

* To develop programming skills that will help in computational of data, develop softwares and systems to help in research and diagnostics.
* To Understand all principals and procedures followed while working on a research project
* to understand multi-Sequence Analysis and  protein sequence prediction.

* Develop soft skills and presentation skills that will help when pitching my ideas and findings.
