## BIOINFORMATICS INTERNSHIP 2020(MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,BIOINFORMATICS,BIOINFORMATICS) AT ICIPE.


### AUTHOR
Virginiah Periah Kengara

## BACKGROUND
My name is Virginiah Periah Kengara. I am a passionate bioinformatics enthusiast. I hold a B.Sc. in Microbiology and Biotechnology from The University of Nairobi and a certificate in Software Development from moringa School . My area of interest is genetic engineering where bioinformatics has become an essential tool.My career  goal is to be a leading medical researcher working on precision medicine, CRISPR cas Technology and bioinformatics to advance the quality of medicine in Africa.

I am currently interning at the MMBU center at ICIPE Kenya and I am so excited for this opportunity because it will equip me with skills in genomics,research  and computational methods. Moreover, having mentors and working on projects will build my portfolio for my postgraduate studies in Bioinformatics.

## MY VISION    
* To learn gene sequencing that is important in precision medicine.

* To learn scripting languages used in biostatistics and analysis(python and R)that will help in computational of data, develop softwares and systems to help in research and diagnostics.
* To Understand all principals and procedures followed while working on a research project
* Understand and work on multi-Sequence Analysis and  protein sequence prediction.
* To learn database intergration and deployment of data to cloud.

*  To develop soft skill,presentation skills and interact with mentors in bioinformatics.
